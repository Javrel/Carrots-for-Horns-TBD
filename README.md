# TBD

Welcome to TBD, the point of this project is for a bunch of begginers interested in game development to learn how to make a simple game, develop a team, and see if we want to do it again with a bit more oomph.

Once we have a our three primary positions filled (code [x] , sound [x] , graphics []) we will decide what we are creating and get underway.

## How we work

More details to follow

## Team Members

### Javrel
#### Lead Dev (Also general project lead)
Principle Data Engineer by trade, have coding experience in python, joining the team as lead dev and project lead. Have only dabbled in game creation years ago. I want to create a game but need a team, so I would like to create a low stress learning environment to create one with likemineded people.

### KriegMorgan
#### Music and Sound Lead
Cellar monkey turned junior accountant by trade, music maker by passion and hobby. Here to make some tunes, kick ass and I would say chew bubblegum but I don't like it.

###Hermitting
#### Lead Apprectice Junior Programmer/Along for the Ride
Junior accountant/billing specialist by trade, with an unbridled enthusiasm for Excel. Starting up a computer science class shortly, and will be working on python shortly after that. Mostly along for the ride, but hoping to be of some use!
