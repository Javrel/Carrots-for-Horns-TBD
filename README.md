# TBD

Welcom to TBD, the point of this project is for a bunch of begginers interested in game development to learn how to make a simple game, develop a team, and see if we want to do it again with a bit more oomph.

Once we have a our three primary positions filled (code [x] , sound [x] , graphics []) we will decide what we are creating and get underway.
